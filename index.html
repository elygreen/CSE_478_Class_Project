                    The lifeline for 40 million people in the American West, the Colorado River is not just a landscape
                    but a critical resource under threat. This is the story of how we got here and what lies ahead. For
                    decades, the river has brought life into the desert, supporting cities, agriculture, and ecosystems,
                    but the era of abundance is ending. After two decades of drought and overallocation, the system is
                    at a breaking point. This presentation explores the history, current state, and future projections.

                    Phoenix has grown by hundreds of thousands of residents since 1990, yet total water production has stayed 
                    roughly the same. This type of growth simply isn't sustainable, and it's not getting any better.

                <p class="text-lg mb-2">
                    Phoenix does not rely on just a single srouce for its water. Instead, it uses a complex combination of
                    different source to meet its water needs: Snowmelt, Colorado River water, reclaimed wastewater, and groundwater
                    all play a role. Understanding where our water comes from is the first step in understanding where vulnerabilities lie.

                    <strong>Trace the flow:</strong> This Sankey diagram visualizes the city's water sources. hover over the flows
                    to see exactly how much water moves from specific sources to homes, industries, and and parks & irrigation and another
                    thing to note: this doesn't include agriculture which uses up to 72% of all our water.

                    the Colorado River's water is divided among the seven basin states and Mexico. The law recognizes the
                    effect that drought has on water availability and includes provisions for reducing allocations during times of shortage.

                    thousands of years to replenish. Yet, as the river's flow diminishes, we are pumping our groundwater
                    faster than nature can put it back, permanently draining our last emergency fund.
